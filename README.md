# Automotive Solution Tool 

This web application uses [The NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa-datasets-and-apis#recalls/) API, [Flickr]( https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/) API, [Yelp]( https://docs.developer.yelp.com/reference/v3_business_search) API, and the [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python) API to help users make informed decisions on a car they plan to purchase. 


## Description

This application will get recall information from the NTSHA website base on the Year, Make, and Model of a car. It will then show three pictures of that car along with YouTube videos regarding the carâ€™s recall(s) and finally, shows the top rated auto shops on yelp that can fix those recall issues.
